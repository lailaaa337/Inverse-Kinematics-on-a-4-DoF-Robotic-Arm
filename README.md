## 🦾 Robot Configuration (DH Parameters)

| Joint | θ (Theta) | d | a | α (Alpha) |
|-------|-----------|---|---|-----------|
| 1 | θ₁ | 0 | 0 | +90° |
| 2 | θ₂ | 0 | L₁ | 0 |
| 3 | θ₃ | 0 | L₂ | 0 |
| 4 | θ₄ | 0 | L₃ | 0 |

## 📐 Forward Kinematics

The end-effector Cartesian position is computed as:

```math
X = cos(θ1) [L2 cos(θ2) + L3 cos(θ2+θ3) + L4 cos(θ2+θ3+θ4)]

Y = sin(θ1) [L2 cos(θ2) + L3 cos(θ2+θ3) + L4 cos(θ2+θ3+θ4)]

Z = L1 + L2 sin(θ2) + L3 sin(θ2+θ3) + L4 sin(θ2+θ3+θ4)
```

These equations determine the spatial position of the robot's end-effector.

## 🔄 Full Transformation Matrices

The homogeneous transformation sequence is:

```text
T1 = Rot(Z, θ1) * Rot(X, 90°)
T2 = Rot(Z, θ2) * Trans(L1, 0, 0)
T3 = Rot(Z, θ3) * Trans(L2, 0, 0)
T4 = Rot(Z, θ4) * Trans(L3, 0, 0)

T_total = T1 * T2 * T3 * T4
```

This produces the complete transformation from base frame to end-effector frame.

## 🔁 Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics was implemented using:

- MATLAB
- Robotics System Toolbox

The toolbox was used to:
- Compute joint angles for a desired end-effector position
- Validate workspace reachability
- Simulate robotic motion

## ✋ Gripper System

### Simulation Environment

The robotic arm and gripper were simulated using **CoppeliaSim**.

The gripper control includes:

- Open/close mechanism  
- Object grasping operations  
- Real-time stability testing  

### Benefits of Simulation

Using CoppeliaSim allowed us to:

- Visualize interaction between gripper and objects  
- Test grasp stability in real time  
- Debug control algorithms safely  
- Prevent hardware damage before real deployment
